# Buzz

Buzz is a self-hosted static site server with a CLI for deploying directories.

## Features

- Deploy or replace a site with one command.
- Serve clean URLs, custom `404.html` pages, and single-page apps with a `200.html` fallback.
- Manage sites through the CLI and browser dashboard.
- Sign in with GitHub or use site-scoped deployment tokens for automation.
- Record site traffic and view analytics in the dashboard.

## Quick Start

You need Node.js 22 or later, npm, a GitHub account, access to a running Buzz server, and a directory of built static files.

1. Install the CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install --global @infomiho/buzz-cli
   ```

2. Configure your server URL:

   ```bash
   buzz config server https://buzz.example.com
   ```

3. Sign in with GitHub. Follow the printed URL and enter the displayed code:

   ```bash
   buzz login
   ```

4. Replace `my-site` with a unique site name and deploy your site:

   ```bash
   buzz deploy ./dist --site my-site
   ```

Buzz prints the URL and stores `my-site` in the current directory's `CNAME`. Later deployments reuse it unless `--site` is supplied.
