Use this guide when you need archive selection and replacement details beyond your [first deployment](../../getting-started/deploy-your-first-site/). Buzz publishes the contents of the selected directory, not the directory itself.

## Prerequisites

Complete [Deploy Your First Site](../../getting-started/deploy-your-first-site/) and build the files you want to publish into `./dist`.

The CLI includes dotfiles, but excludes these paths from the archive:

- `.git`
- `node_modules`
- `.vscode`
- `.idea`
- `.DS_Store` files
- `.env` and `.env.*` files

Keep `index.html` at the root of `./dist` when it should serve at the root site URL. The CLI uploads regular build output from the directory and the server validates the resulting ZIP archive before publishing it.

## Replace A Site

Deploy the new build with the same site name:

```bash
buzz deploy ./dist --site my-site
```

A successful redeployment creates a numbered, immutable deployment and makes it live. Files omitted from the new build are not part of the new deployment. If validation or publishing fails, Buzz keeps serving the previous deployment.

Buzz retains the 10 most recent deployments for each site. Older deployments and their files are removed automatically. List retained deployments with `buzz deployments list`, or make one live with `buzz deployments use <deployment-number>`.

Only the owner can replace a site. A deployment token can replace only the site to which it is scoped.

## Inspect The Deployment

Show the site URL stored for the current project:

```bash
buzz url
```

List the sites owned by the signed-in user:

```bash
buzz list
```

For naming behavior, read [Choose A Site Name](../choose-a-site-name/). For automation, read [Automate Deployments](../automate-deployments/).
