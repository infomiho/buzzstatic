description: How Buzz maps site requests to deployed files and fallback pages.
---

Buzz serves each deployed site from its site hostname. This reference describes file lookup, fallback status codes, methods, and content types.

Each site deployment is an immutable, numbered set of files. Exactly one retained deployment is live. Buzz keeps the 10 most recent deployments and automatically removes older deployment history and files.

## Site Hostnames

With `BUZZ_DOMAIN=buzz.example.com`, the control host is `buzz.example.com` and a site named `my-site` is served from `my-site.buzz.example.com`.

Requests to a site hostname are isolated from control routes. For example, `/health` on a site hostname looks for that site's content instead of returning the Buzz server health response.

Site hostnames accept `GET` and `HEAD`. Other methods return `405 Method Not Allowed` with `Allow: GET, HEAD`.

## Custom Hostname Normalization

When the optional custom-domain control plane is enabled, Buzz trims surrounding whitespace and a trailing dot, applies non-transitional UTS #46 processing through IDNA2008, and stores the lowercase ASCII hostname. For example, `München.Example.` becomes `xn--mnchen-3ya.example`.

Claims reject URLs, ports, paths, wildcards, IP addresses, single-label and local names, and the configured Buzz domain or any of its subdomains. TXT verification and routing always use the normalized ASCII hostname.

A site can have multiple independently verified custom hostnames. Every alias serves the same deployment and analytics identity as the permanent Buzz hostname. Removing one alias does not affect the others or change the site's deployment name.

Explicit `direct` claims activate after DNS and origin validation. Explicit `cloudflare` claims run credential-free edge and origin diagnostics and can activate only when the server operator enables Cloudflare activation. When the client omits the mode, Buzz accepts the claim only if automatic path observation is ready; it never silently substitutes an explicit direct claim.

Automatic claims may transition between direct and Cloudflare paths after generation-qualified DNS and path evidence is stable. Missing, invalid, or stale Cloudflare range data blocks Cloudflare cutover and immediately fails closed for an active Cloudflare path. Cloudflare range validation and confirmation include every A and AAAA answer. Every address in a runtime-reachable family must pass edge TLS and challenge validation. Buzz tolerates a wholly unroutable IPv6 family only when every IPv6 address has an address-family routing limitation and IPv4 fully validates; partial or ordinary failures remain blocking.

## File Lookup Order

Buzz decodes the URL path, rejects paths that escape the site directory, and checks candidates in this order:

1. The exact requested file.
2. If the path ends in `/`, `index.html` inside that directory.
3. If the resulting path does not end in `.html`, the same path with `.html` appended.
4. If the resulting path does not end in `.html`, `index.html` below that path.
5. The site's root `200.html` fallback.
6. The site's root `404.html` page.
7. Buzz's plain-text `404 Not Found` response.

The first matching file is returned. Buzz does not redirect a clean URL to the underlying HTML file.

Common paths resolve as follows:

| Request | Candidate |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | `/index.html` |
| `/about` | `/about`, then `/about.html`, then `/about/index.html` |
| `/docs/` | `/docs/index.html` |
| `/assets/app.js` | `/assets/app.js` first |

Query parameters do not change file lookup. A request for `/assets/app.js?v=2` serves `/assets/app.js` when it exists.

## Single-Page Application Fallback

Add `200.html` at the root of a deployed site to handle client-side routes. Buzz serves it only after the requested file and clean-URL candidates do not exist.

The fallback response has status `200`, so a browser can load the application and let its router interpret the original URL. Because `200.html` is checked before `404.html`, a site with both files uses `200.html` for every otherwise unmatched path.

## Not Found Responses

If no requested file or `200.html` fallback matches, Buzz checks for `404.html` at the site root. A custom page is returned with status `404` and content type `text/html`.

If the site has no custom page, Buzz returns plain text with status `404`. A hostname without a deployed site also returns `404`.

## Content Types

Buzz chooses a response content type from the served file's extension:

| Extension | Content Type |
| --- | --- |
| `.html` | `text/html` |
| `.css` | `text/css` |
| `.js` | `application/javascript` |
| `.json` | `application/json` |
| `.png` | `image/png` |
| `.jpg`, `.jpeg` | `image/jpeg` |
| `.gif` | `image/gif` |
| `.svg` | `image/svg+xml` |
| `.ico` | `image/x-icon` |
| `.txt` | `text/plain` |
| `.xml` | `application/xml` |

Files with any other extension use `application/octet-stream`.
