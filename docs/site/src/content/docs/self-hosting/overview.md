Run Buzz on infrastructure you control with Docker Compose or Coolify. This section covers the public DNS, TLS, authentication, persistent data, and operational settings needed for a production installation.

## Decide Who May Reach Buzz

Before exposing Buzz, decide who may sign in. By default, any reachable GitHub user can create sites and consume storage. Use `BUZZ_ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` for a username allowlist. Buzz has no built-in rate limiting or total or per-user storage quota.

If Buzz is for a closed group, configure and verify access controls and rate limits at an upstream proxy, virtual private network, or firewall before deployment. [Review Buzz's security boundaries](../security/) for the controls the upstream layer must provide.

## Prepare The Host

You need:

- A Linux server with Docker Engine and Docker Compose, or a Coolify server.
- A domain whose DNS records you can change. These guides use `buzz.example.com` as the Buzz domain.
- Public access to TCP ports `80` and `443`. Port `80` serves the HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect and the certificate challenges for custom domains.
- A GitHub account that can create an OAuth app.
- A backup destination outside the Docker host.

The domain's DNS zone must be hosted on Cloudflare. Buzz obtains its wildcard certificate from Let's Encrypt through DNS-01 validation with the Cloudflare API. Other DNS providers aren't supported.

## Choose A Deployment Path

- Use [Docker Compose](../docker-compose/) when you manage Docker and Traefik on the host.
- Use [Coolify](../coolify/) when Coolify already manages the host and its Traefik proxy. Buzz needs no changes to Coolify's proxy.

Both paths run the published Buzz server image and mount the named volume `buzz_buzz-data` at `/data`. The volume contains deployed site files, the SQLite database, users, sessions, deployment tokens, analytics, and the wildcard certificate.

## Understand The Public Endpoints

Buzz routes requests by hostname:

- `https://buzz.example.com` serves the dashboard and API.
- `https://my-site.buzz.example.com` serves the site named `my-site`.

The base hostname and wildcard hostname must both resolve to the server. TLS must cover `buzz.example.com` and `*.buzz.example.com`.

## Complete The Production Setup

1. Decide whether the server may be public. Configure upstream controls first if access must be restricted.
2. Choose the Buzz domain and [configure DNS and TLS](../configure-dns-and-tls/) for the base and wildcard hostnames.
3. [Create the GitHub OAuth app](../configure-github-authentication/) for the intended dashboard URL.
4. Deploy Buzz with [Docker Compose](../docker-compose/) or [Coolify](../coolify/) using the domain and GitHub credentials.
5. Follow the selected deployment guide's success checks.
6. [Configure deployment limits](../configure-deployment-limits/) for the host.
7. [Create and verify a backup](../manage-data-and-backups/).

Use the [configuration reference](../../reference/configuration/) for the complete environment variable list.
