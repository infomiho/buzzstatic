Buzz is a small self-hosted service, not a security boundary for mutually untrusted tenants. Assess it against your own threat model before hosting sensitive or untrusted workloads.

## Control Who Can Use The Server

Buzz authenticates users through a GitHub OAuth app. By default any GitHub user who can reach the server can sign in, create sites, and consume storage. Two environment variables restrict this:

- `BUZZ_ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` stops new sign-ups. Existing users keep signing in and deploying.
- `BUZZ_ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS=alice,bob` allows only the listed GitHub usernames. Unlisted users are denied on every request, including active dashboard sessions and existing deployment tokens. Listed users can sign up even when registration is disabled.

Matching is case-insensitive, and the allowlist wins when both variables are set. Removing a username from the allowlist suspends access without deleting anything; adding it back restores the user's sessions and deployment tokens. The allowlist matches GitHub usernames, so update it when a listed user renames their GitHub account.

Denied users see the same message whether registration is closed or they are missing from the allowlist. The server logs each blocked attempt with the GitHub username, so check the logs when deciding who to add.

Set these variables before creating public DNS records or starting the deployment. Restrict network access at an upstream proxy, virtual private network, or firewall when the server is intended for a closed group. Buzz doesn't include rate limiting, so add and verify rate limits upstream if your threat model requires them.

## Protect Credentials

- Store `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `BUZZ_ANALYTICS_SECRET`, `BUZZ_CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN`, and `BUZZ_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_OPERATOR_TOKEN` outside source control.
- Scope the Cloudflare token to the zone of `BUZZ_DOMAIN` with only Zone:Read and DNS:Edit. It can still edit every record in that zone.
- Restrict secret-file and deployment-console access to operators.
- Use site-scoped deployment tokens for automation instead of a user session.
- Revoke a deployment token when its workflow no longer needs access.
- Rotate any secret that appears in logs or source control.

The wildcard certificate's private key is stored in `/data/tls` and in `buzz-certificate.yaml` in Traefik's dynamic configuration directory, the same trust domain as Traefik's own ACME storage. On Coolify, users who can manage the server can read it under **Servers > Proxy > Dynamic Configurations**. Other team members see only the file name.

Buzz stores hashes of session and deployment tokens in SQLite, not their raw values. Sessions expire after 30 days. Deployment tokens currently have no expiry when created through the supported flow, so revocation is an operator responsibility.

## Treat Deployed Files As Untrusted Content

Buzz validates ZIP paths, rejects symbolic links and encrypted entries, and extracts deployments into staging directories. These checks address archive extraction, not the contents of the files.

Buzz doesn't scan deployments for malware, phishing content, secrets, or harmful JavaScript. A deployed site can execute active content in its visitors' browsers. Review who can deploy, monitor hosted content, and use external scanning or policy controls when required.

Sites use separate subdomains, and the dashboard session cookie is host-only, `HttpOnly`, `Secure` outside development mode, and `SameSite=Lax`.

## Limit Exposure And Resource Use

- Expose the Buzz container through HTTPS rather than publishing port `8080` directly.
- Keep the Docker socket mount read-only and limit host access. Traefik still receives broad Docker metadata access through that socket.
- Buzz can write to Traefik's dynamic configuration directory, which every application behind the same proxy shares. A compromised Buzz container could add routes or certificates for other hostnames on that proxy.
- Don't route the private port `8081` or Traefik's API through the proxy.
- Set [deployment limits](../configure-deployment-limits/) appropriate for the host.
- Monitor free disk space. Buzz has per-deployment limits, but no total storage quota, per-user quota, or maximum site count.
- Back up `/data` and test restoration using [Manage Data And Backups](../manage-data-and-backups/).
- Apply operating system, Docker, Coolify, Traefik, and Buzz updates after reviewing their release notes.

## Keep Persistent Volumes Out Of Cleanup

Deleting an unused Docker volume permanently removes the Buzz data or certificate state stored in it. Do not run `docker compose down --volumes`, `docker system prune --volumes`, or `docker volume prune` as routine maintenance.

For Coolify, open **Servers**, select the server, and open **Configuration > Advanced**. Leave unused-volume cleanup disabled. Coolify's [Automated Docker Cleanup](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/automated-cleanup) documentation states that this optional cleanup can cause data loss. A stopped application can leave `buzz_buzz-data` unattached and therefore eligible for volume cleanup.

Before any manual cleanup, inspect the target list and confirm that `buzz_buzz-data`, `buzz_traefik-certs`, and any restored or rollback volumes are excluded. Keep an off-host, checksum-verified backup even when volumes are excluded from cleanup.

## Understand Analytics Data

Buzz records aggregate site analytics in `/data/data.db`. It can derive a daily visitor hash from the client IP address and user agent, store referrer hosts, campaign values, paths, and country headers, and retain daily aggregate records. Raw visitor hashes become eligible for pruning after two days and are removed when Buzz writes a later analytics batch.

Set a stable, random `BUZZ_ANALYTICS_SECRET`. Otherwise Buzz falls back to `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, then a process-local random value. The bundled Compose files pass this variable to the server when it is defined in the deployment environment.

Determine your own disclosure, consent, retention, and access obligations for the jurisdictions where you operate.
